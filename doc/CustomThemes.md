# Adding A Custom Theme

1. Open the Settings Dialog
2. Navigate to the System Tab
3. In the "Additional Styles" box add these lines of code:

```css
.memo-list-container {background-color: #INSERT COLOR HERE;}
.page-container {background-color: #INSERT COLOR HERE;}
```

  It is recommended that you choose the same color for both options

4. Refresh the page and the background color of your memos app will successfully update to reflect your changes
