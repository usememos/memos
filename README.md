## Overview

Memos is a privacy-first, self-hosted knowledge base that works seamlessly for personal notes, team wikis, and knowledge management. Built with Go and React, it offers lightning-fast performance without compromising on features or usability.

**Why choose Memos over cloud services?**

| Feature           | Memos                          | Cloud Services                |

| **Cost**          | ✅ Free forever, MIT license   | ❌ Subscription fees          |
| **Performance**   | ✅ Instant load, no latency    | ⚠️ Depends on internet        |
